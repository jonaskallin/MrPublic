<div th:fragment="alerts (indexN, charts)">
  <h5>[[${indexN}]] | Alerts</h5>
  <p>
    This section contains a summary of all triggered, active and resolved alerts, for this report period.
  </p>
  <p>Alerts are classified into two categories:</p>
  <ul class="overview-ul">
    <li>
      <b class="danger">Error</b>:
      Indicate a severe incident within your environment or system, such as a complete outage or unavailability of a system or any of its components. These alert types have the highest severity level.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b class="warning">Warning</b>:
      Indicates an incident that might impact your environment or system performance, such as almost reaching your system threads usage. These alert types should be carefully analyzed to avoid escalation to an error alert.
    </li>
  </ul>
